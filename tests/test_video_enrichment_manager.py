"""Wiring guards for the video "Manage Workers" modal (video-enrichment-manager.js).

Pins two behaviours the user asked for:
  - clicking a coverage card just SWITCHES THE VIEW — it must not change the global
    "process first" priority or silently re-queue failed items (those are the top
    Movies/Shows/Auto tabs and the explicit "Retry all failed" button);
  - "Retry all failed" re-queues EVERY coverage kind the worker handles, not just
    the tab being viewed.
