"""Regression for the watchlist_artists rebuild dropping amazon_artist_id.

`amazon_artist_id` is added to watchlist_artists via ALTER (music_database.py
~1732), but the table-rebuild migrations (the spotify_id-nullable fix and the
profile-scoped UNIQUE rebuild) recreated the table from a hardcoded column list
that omitted amazon_artist_id — so on upgrade the column AND any stored Amazon
artist IDs were silently dropped.

These tests drive the REAL migrations through MusicDatabase() against a fresh
temp database that starts in the pre-migration shape (no profile-scoped UNIQUE,
amazon_artist_id present with data), then assert the column and its data survive.

Proven differential: with database/music_database.py reverted to pre-fix,
test_amazon_artist_id_data_survives_rebuild FAILS (the column/data are dropped);
with the fix it passes.
