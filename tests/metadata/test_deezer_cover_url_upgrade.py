"""Pin the Deezer CDN cover-URL upgrade helper.

Discord report (Tim, 2026-05-XX): downloaded cover art via Deezer
metadata source comes out blurry — visibly low-res in Navidrome.
Cause: Deezer's API returns ``cover_xl`` URLs at 1000×1000 but the
underlying CDN serves up to 1900×1900 by rewriting the size segment
in the URL path. SoulSync wasn't doing the rewrite.

Helper: ``_upgrade_deezer_cover_url(url, target_size=1900)`` — pure
function, lifts to one boundary so cover-download sites don't each
re-implement the regex. Tests pin every input shape:

- Standard Deezer URL → upgraded to target
- Non-Deezer URL → returned unchanged
- Already at/above target → returned unchanged (no needless rewrite)
- Empty / None → returned as-is
- Custom target → applied correctly
- Picture URLs (artist) — same path pattern, also upgraded
