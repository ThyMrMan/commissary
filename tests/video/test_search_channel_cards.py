"""Search page — YouTube channel results as native poster tiles.

Boulder: the channel results felt disconnected (own card component, own grid,
buried under People). Now they render as the SAME .vsr-card poster tile the
movie/TV results use (shared .vsr-grid, hover-lift, peek), avatar centered on a
YouTube-branded ground, and the group sits right after TV Shows (before People).
