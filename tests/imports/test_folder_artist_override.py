"""Folder-artist override can be disabled to keep an identified artist.

Background
----------

The auto-import "parent folder artist override" used to fire unconditionally:
whenever the Staging path had >=2 levels and the top folder wasn't a category
word, it replaced the (already metadata-identified) artist with the top folder
name. A user who staged a mixed pile of singles under one container folder
named ``soulsync`` therefore got the album-artist of *every* file forced to
"soulsync" — even when the track was confidently resolved to a real artist
with a Spotify/MusicBrainz id. Navidrome groups by album-artist, so 65 singles
collapsed under a bogus "soulsync" artist.

``resolve_folder_artist`` is the extracted, pure decision. It must keep the
identified artist when the feature is OFF, and reproduce the original
folder-derived artist when enabled.
