"""Regression tests for routing singles/EPs through the album_path template.

Discord-reported scenario (winecountrygames + fresh.dumbledore):
"Import only makes Albums folder no singles or eps". Users with a
``${albumtype}s/$albumartist/...`` ``album_path`` template saw an
"Albums" folder fill up correctly, but singles never produced a
"Singles" folder because the staging/auto-import code routed them
through the ``single_path`` template (which doesn't honour
``$albumtype``).

The detection in ``build_import_album_info`` previously required
``total_tracks > 1`` AND ``album_name != track_title``. Singles fail
both — they have one track and the release is usually named after
the song.

Fix: when the metadata source explicitly identifies the release
type ("single" / "ep" / "compilation"), trust it and route through
``album_path`` so the user's ``$albumtype``-aware template runs.
``"album"`` is excluded — it's the default fallback for missing
metadata, so triggering on it would change behaviour for
single-track downloads that happen to have no source data.
