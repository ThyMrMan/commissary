"""Pin the bounded-executor + scan-lock concurrency model in
``AutoImportWorker``.

Pre-refactor (before 2026-05-09): manual "Scan Now" clicks spawned a
fresh `threading.Thread(target=_scan_cycle)` per click on top of the
worker's existing 60-second timer-driven scan. Emergent parallelism
with no upper bound, no shared queue, no graceful shutdown. Different
scan cycles raced on `_processing_paths` / `_folder_snapshots` state.

Post-refactor:
- ONE scan at a time (`_scan_lock` non-blocking acquire — duplicate
  triggers no-op).
- Per-candidate processing runs on a `ThreadPoolExecutor` (default 3
  workers, configurable via `auto_import.max_workers`).
- Both timer + manual triggers share `trigger_scan()` so they go
  through the same lock + executor.

These tests pin the CONCURRENCY CONTRACT, not the per-candidate
processing logic (which is covered separately by
``test_auto_import_live_progress.py`` etc.).
