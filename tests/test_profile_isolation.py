"""Profile-isolation audit fixes (the deferred profile-system bug list).

1. delete_profile sweeps EVERY table with a profile_id column (schema-derived)
   — the old hardcoded 8-table list orphaned per-profile service credentials,
   notification history, issues, blocklists and more, and silently fell
   further behind with every new profile feature.
2. The video DB gets the same schema-derived sweep for its profile-keyed rows
   (requests, issues), called when a profile is deleted.
3. The mirrored-playlist by-id HTTP routes carry an owner-or-admin gate
   (mirrored_playlist_visible) — the IDOR where any profile could read,
   rename, re-point, pipeline-run, or DELETE another's playlists by id.
4. The socket room joins derive the profile from the SESSION, and playlist-
   keyed push rooms (sync:/discovery:) apply the same owner-or-admin rule.

Routes/sockets are pinned at the source level (importing web_server boots the
app); the DB sweeps run for real on tmp databases.
