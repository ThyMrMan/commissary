"""`core.quality.selection.load_profile_by_id` — resolves a specific
`quality_profiles` row (falling back to the app-wide default), the seam that
lets a wishlist row's own `quality_profile_id` drive per-item download
ranking (`task_worker._candidate_ordering`) and import acceptance
(`core.imports.guards.check_quality_target`) instead of always the global
profile.
