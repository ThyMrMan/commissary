"""Divergent-version matching: two DIFFERENT versions of the same base
title must NOT match.

Context: Tidal stores remix/live/edit qualifiers in a dedicated `version`
field which `_tidal_to_track_result` now folds into the candidate title so
the matcher can see it. That fix made the *correct* version win — but it
also makes OTHER versions of the same song visible ("We Are The People
(Shazam Remix)" vs "(southstar Remix)"). Neither title is a prefix of the
other, so the original prefix-based version check missed them and the raw
ratio stayed high (~0.8) off the shared base. Without discrimination, when
the requested version is absent a different remix could outscore the
threshold and the wrong cut would be downloaded.

These pin: different descriptors reject, the correct one still wins, and
the existing original-vs-version / remaster behaviour is preserved.
