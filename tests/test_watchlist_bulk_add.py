"""Regression tests for the bulk "Add unwatched library artists to
watchlist" endpoint.

Discord report: bulk add silently skipped library artists that didn't
have an ID for the user's currently active metadata source. A
Spotify-primary user with library artists matched only against iTunes
or Deezer would see them counted as ``skipped_no_id`` and never make
it onto the watchlist — the user perceived this as "Library and
Watchlist not syncing correctly".

These tests pin the new behaviour: try the active source first, then
fall back to any other source ID the artist carries. Drop only when
the artist has zero source IDs.
