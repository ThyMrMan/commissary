"""Server Playlists compare view — #1005 string contracts.

Pins the three fixes: the active filter pill is re-applied after every column
render (pill said Missing, rows showed all); a single Find & Add / remove
patches the pair in place instead of re-fetching + re-matching a 2k-track
playlist; and the in-place repaint keeps the scroll position."""
