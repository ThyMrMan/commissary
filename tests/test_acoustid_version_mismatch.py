"""AcoustID verification rejects version mismatches (instrumental / live / etc).

Discord report (corruption [BWC]): downloads coming through as instrumentals
when the user expected vocal versions. Slipped past AcoustID verification
because the ``_normalize`` step strips parentheticals and version-suffix
tags ("(Instrumental)", "- Live", etc) so that legitimate name variations
don't fail the title-similarity check. Side effect: "Song Name" and
"Song Name (Instrumental)" both normalize to "song name", title sim is
1.0, file passes verification despite being the wrong cut.

Fix: detect the version label on each side BEFORE normalization runs.
If the expected and matched versions disagree, return FAIL — the
fingerprint did identify a real song, just not the version the caller
asked for.

Reuses ``MusicMatchingEngine.detect_version_type`` so the same patterns
that the pre-download Soulseek matcher uses also drive post-download
verification (no duplicated regex tables).
