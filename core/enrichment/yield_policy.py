"""Enrichment-worker yield policy: who pauses while the user's foreground
work is running.

Background enrichment workers share external API budgets with the foreground
pipelines — most painfully MusicBrainz (~1 req/s per IP), where a worker
grinding through the library can starve the import pipeline's per-track
lookups into multi-minute crawls (measured: ~4m15s/track vs the normal ~20s).

Policy (set with Boulder, 2026-06-06):
  - downloads active   -> EVERYTHING yields (post-processing touches every
                          metadata source: MusicBrainz, Spotify, iTunes,
                          Deezer, Discogs, Last.fm, Genius, ...)
  - discovery active   -> the API-contention five yield (discovery hammers
                          the track-matching sources only)
Workers the user explicitly resumed mid-yield are honored upstream (the
override set lives in web_server's loop, as does the user-paused bookkeeping).
