"""Automation handler: ``video_scan_watchlist_people`` action.

The video "watchlist" follows ongoing *things* — shows, channels, and people. For shows
the ``video_add_airing_episodes`` automation already keeps the wishlist fed. This handler
does the equivalent for the PEOPLE you follow:

For every person on the watchlist, look up their filmography and wishlist every MOVIE the
user doesn't already own — the whole back catalog they acted in or directed, plus anything
upcoming. The first run is the meaty one (it backlogs everything); later runs are fast
because they skip movies already on the wishlist and only promote ones that have since been
released.

Design decisions (Boulder):
  * MOVIES ONLY — no TV episodes for a person (shows are handled by their own automation).
  * Both ACTOR (Acting credits, minus "playing themselves") and DIRECTOR credits count.
  * UNRELEASED movies are added as ``status='monitored'`` so the wishlist/download engine
    leaves them alone until they're out; a later scan PROMOTES them to ``'wanted'``.
  * Best-in-class UX: grab as much data as possible at add time (backdrop, overview, genres,
    runtime, rating, top cast, director, release date, + provenance "because you follow X")
    and stash it as a rich ``detail_json`` blob on the wishlist row, so the UI renders a full
    card later without re-fetching.

Like the other video handlers this lives on the SHARED automation side (so it may import
``core.video`` / ``api.video`` — the isolation contract only forbids the reverse) and owns
its own progress (``_manages_own_progress``). All I/O is injected as seams, so the logic is
a pure function in tests (no DB, no TMDB); production lazily binds the real calls.
