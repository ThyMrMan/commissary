"""Wishlist ignore-list — a TTL'd skip-gate for the wishlist (#874).

When a user removes a track from the wishlist or cancels an in-flight
wishlist download, SoulSync would otherwise re-add it on the next
automatic cycle (watchlist scan, failed-track capture, or the cancel
handler's own re-add), so the same release downloads → fails/cancels →
re-queues forever. The ignore list records the user's "stop
auto-grabbing this" intent, and the wishlist *add* path checks it,
skipping automatic re-adds until the entry ages out.

It is deliberately softer than the blocklist:
  - it **expires** after ``IGNORE_TTL_DAYS`` so the track is re-attempted
    again later rather than banned forever, and
  - it **never blocks a manual force-download** — only the automatic
    re-queue. (Manual downloads don't go through ``add_to_wishlist`` at
    all, and an explicit manual *add* both bypasses the gate and clears
    any existing ignore for the track.)

This module is pure decision logic — no database handle and no clock of
its own; the caller passes ``now``. The SQL lives in ``MusicDatabase``
as a thin wrapper around these helpers, which keeps the TTL / id-matching
rules unit-testable without a database.
