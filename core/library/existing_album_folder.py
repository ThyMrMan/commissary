"""Reuse an album's existing on-disk folder for new downloads (#829).

When tracks are added to an album across multiple batches (a wishlist run, the
Album Completeness job, a missed track re-downloaded later), the destination
folder is normally rebuilt from API metadata each time. If ``$albumtype`` or
``$year`` come back blank/different on a later batch, the folder *name* changes
and the album splits across folders — forcing a Reorganize afterwards.

This resolves the folder the album *already* lives in so the new track joins its
existing files instead. Matching is deliberately conservative: the exact stored
Spotify album id first (definitive), then a STRICT (>= 0.85) name+artist match —
higher than the 0.7 used elsewhere, because a wrong match here misplaces a file.

Safety rails:
  * Only ever returns a folder UNDER the transfer dir (the managed download
    tree) — never a read-only library/NAS mount the resolver happens to find.
  * Only reuses when the album lives in EXACTLY ONE folder on disk. Multiple
    folders means disc subfolders (DatabaseTrack carries no disc number, so we
    can't safely pick the right one) — those defer to the template path.
  * Any failure returns None — the caller falls back to the normal template.
