"""Choosing which copy of a duplicate track to keep.

The keeper is the highest-quality copy, and **format/lossless is the primary
criterion**: a lossless FLAC must beat a lossy MP3 regardless of the recorded
bitrate number — a FLAC whose bitrate the library scan never populated (a
common gap) still has to win over a 282 kbps MP3. Only *within* the same format
tier do bitrate, then duration, then track number break the tie.

This was lifted out of the repair worker so the deletion path and the UI's
"Keep Best" recommendation rank identically (previously both ranked by bitrate
first, which kept the MP3 when the FLAC's bitrate was missing), and so the
ranking is unit-testable in isolation.
