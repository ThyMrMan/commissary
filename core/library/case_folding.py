"""Reuse a folder that already exists in a different case (#1091).

Ported from upstream SoulSync 3.2.2.

Reported by TomOdellSheetMusic: reorganize and download build every
destination folder from metadata, so if the metadata's casing differs from
the folder already on disk you get two folders for one album.

WHY THIS BITES DIFFERENTLY PER PLATFORM, and why both halves are bad:

  * case-SENSITIVE (his setup — Linux/proxmox): you genuinely get two
    directories, "Artist/Artist - Album" and "artist/artist - album". Jellyfin
    shows the album twice and Commissary cannot tell which tracks belong
    together.
  * case-INSENSITIVE (Windows, default macOS): the second makedirs quietly
    lands in the FIRST folder, so the files are fine but the path Commissary
    recorded is not the path on disk. That is the "broken browsing behaviour"
    half — every later exact-path lookup misses.

So this is not a cosmetic issue on either kind of filesystem, and a fix that
only helps one of them is not a fix.

DISTINCT FROM `_keep_user_casing` (core/library_reorganize.py), which stops
reorganize CHURNING a folder's name when the source's casing differs. That is
about not renaming; this is about not creating a duplicate. Both can be true
at once, and the churn fix does not prevent the split.

DELIBERATELY NOT A MERGE. This only steers NEW writes to the folder that
already exists. Two folders that are already split stay split until something
moves their files — which is what a reorganize run does, since every track
then resolves to the same surviving folder.
