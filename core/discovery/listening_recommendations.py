"""Listening-driven recommendation core (#913).

PURE, side-effect-free ranking that turns "the artists you listen to most" plus
"who's similar to each" into:

  1. a consensus-ranked list of artists you'd probably love but don't own, and
  2. an aggregated candidate-track list for a generated playlist.

No DB / network / config here. The caller (the watchlist scanner) supplies the
seeds (top-played artists), the ``similar_artists`` rows per seed, and the
owned-artist set, then fetches top tracks for the winners. Keeping the decision
logic in one pure place makes it fully unit-testable without the live stack and
keeps the scan wiring thin — and additive, so it can't disturb existing flows.

Scoring rationale (the "best in class" bit): a recommended artist's score is
``Σ over the seeds that recommend it of (seed_weight × similarity)``. That single
sum rewards all three signals at once — **consensus** (an artist endorsed by many
of your seeds accumulates more terms), your **play weight** (heavier seeds push
harder), and **similarity strength** — instead of a flat "appears in N lists".
``seed_count`` is exposed separately for display ("because you like A, B, C") and
as the adventurousness dial's lever (``min_seed_count``).

    of getting no genre chip. Additive — at the default dial the output is unchanged.
