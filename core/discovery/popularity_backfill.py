"""Background popularity backfill (aurral parity).

Walks the ``similar_artists`` rows MusicMap left at popularity 0 and fills them via the
Spotify Free -> Last.fm -> Deezer cascade (``core.discovery.popularity.fetch_artist_popularity``).

Safe by construction:
- **rate-limited per source** — Last.fm and Deezer throttle themselves inside their own clients, so we
  add no delay for them; only Spotify Free (no internal limiter) gets a per-artist pause. Never hammers;
- **resumable** — each run picks up whatever is still missing;
- **cancellable** — ``cancel()`` stops it cleanly;
- **terminating** — a found value is floored to >= 1 (so an obscure artist that normalizes to 0 isn't
  re-read as "unfilled" = 0 and re-fetched forever), an unresolvable artist gets a ``-1`` sentinel, and
  a per-run "seen" set bails if updates ever stop sticking. A sweep always ends, never loops the same
  rows. The dial clamps the -1 / low values to no (or soft) penalty.

The clients are injected (the web layer resolves them), so the sweep itself is unit-testable.
