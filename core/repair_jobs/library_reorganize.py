"""Library Reorganize Job — moves files to match the current file organization template.

Pre-rewrite this job had its own tag-reading + transfer-folder-walk +
template-application implementation that worked off file tags. The
classification heuristic ``is_album = (group_size > 1)`` (where
``group_size`` was the count of tracks for the same album currently
sitting in the transfer folder being scanned) misclassified album
tracks as singles whenever:

- only one track of an album lived in the transfer folder (the rest
  already moved to the library, or not yet downloaded), or
- album tags varied slightly across tracks (e.g. "Buds" vs
  "Buds (Bonus)"), splitting them into separate single-element groups.

Result: those tracks got routed through the SINGLE template and ended
up at e.g. ``Surf Curse/Surf Curse - Christine F/Surf Curse - Christine F.flac``
instead of the album destination.

GitHub issue #500 (@bafoed). Fix: delegate to the per-album planner
(``core.library_reorganize.preview_album_reorganize`` /
``reorganize_album``) the per-album reorganize modal already uses. The
planner is DB-driven — it knows the album has multiple tracks
regardless of how many currently sit in the transfer folder, so the
album-vs-single classification is structurally correct.

Apply mode delegates to ``core.reorganize_queue`` so the actual file
move + post-processing + DB update + sidecar handling all flow
through the same code path the per-album modal uses. No second move
implementation to keep in sync.

Safety design:
- Dry run mode is ON by default. Disabled by user explicitly.
- Job is disabled by default — never auto-runs unless user enables.
- Only DB-known tracks are considered. Files in transfer with no DB
  entry are handled by the separate ``orphan_file_detector`` job.
- Albums with no matching metadata source ID are skipped with a
  clear "needs enrichment first" finding rather than guessed at.
