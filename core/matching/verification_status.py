"""Verification-status vocabulary for imported tracks.

Three states, persisted in the DB (``tracks.verification_status``) AND as an
embedded file tag (``SOULSYNC_VERIFICATION``) so the information survives DB
resets and travels with the file:

- ``verified``       — clean AcoustID PASS at import time.
- ``unverified``     — AcoustID SKIP (cross-script / ambiguous / no match in
                       the AcoustID DB). Imported, but not hard-confirmed.
- ``force_imported`` — accepted via the version-mismatch fallback after the
                       retry budget was exhausted (user opted in via
                       ``post_processing.accept_version_mismatch_fallback``).
                       A later library scan will still re-check these but
                       reports them as informational, clearly marked.

Quarantined files are never imported, so they carry no status.
