"""Canonical contract every download source plugin must satisfy.

`DownloadSourcePlugin` is a structural Protocol — any class that
implements these methods with matching signatures is automatically
treated as a download source. No inheritance required, no manual
registration required beyond the registry entry.

The protocol is intentionally narrow — only the methods the
orchestrator dispatches generically across all sources. Source-
specific extras (Soulseek's slskd internals, Lidarr's album-only
flow, etc.) stay on the underlying client and are accessed through
the registry's typed accessor.

This file is the FOUNDATION step. Existing client classes
(SoulseekClient, YouTubeClient, TidalDownloadClient, etc.) already
conform structurally — they grew the same shape independently
because every consumer site needed the same calls. This file just
makes the implicit contract explicit so:

- Type checkers can flag drift if a new source forgets a method.
- The orchestrator can iterate plugins generically instead of
  hardcoding `[self.soulseek, self.youtube, ...]` everywhere.
- Future PRs can move shared logic INTO the contract (a base
  class with default implementations) without changing the
  signature surface every consumer already depends on.
