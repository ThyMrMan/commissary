"""Shared helpers for the album-bundle download flow.

The torrent and usenet download plugins both implement a
``download_album_to_staging`` method that searches Prowlarr for a
whole release, hands it to the active downloader, walks the
resulting audio files, and copies them into the staging folder. The
two implementations share the same release-picker heuristic and the
same staging-path collision logic.

Pulled out of ``core/download_plugins/torrent.py`` so the usenet
plugin doesn't have to import private helpers from a sibling
plugin (Cin's "no leaky module boundaries" standard).

Also exposes ``atomic_copy_to_staging`` — the audio file is copied
to a ``.tmp.<random>`` sidecar first and atomically renamed onto its
final extension. The Auto-Import worker filters by audio extension
so the in-flight ``.tmp`` file is never picked up mid-copy, closing
the race between the album-bundle copy loop and Auto-Import's
folder scan.

    Lifted out of ``UsenetDownloadPlugin._poll_album_download`` and the
    sibling torrent method so the loop is testable in isolation and so
    both plugins share the same exit semantics.

    Contract:
    - ``get_status()`` returns the adapter status object for the bound
      job, ``None`` when the client doesn't know about the job
      currently (transient or terminal — disambiguated by retry count).
    - ``emit(state, **fields)`` is the plugin's progress callback —
      this function calls it on EVERY successful poll with
      ``state='downloading'`` and ALWAYS calls it once more with
      ``state='failed'`` before returning ``None`` on any failure path,
      so the UI doesn't freeze on the last 'downloading' emit.
    - ``complete_states`` is the adapter's terminal-success set
      ('completed' alone for usenet; 'seeding' + 'completed' for
      torrent because seeding-but-files-on-disk also counts).
    - ``failed_states`` is the explicit-failure set. The adapter-level
      'error' (unmapped state default) is intentionally NOT in here —
      that's treated as a transient miss because a real SAB / NZBGet
      / qBit never returns a literal 'error' state on a healthy job;
      it's only our default fallback for unknown queue strings. Real
      example: SAB's 'Pp' post-processing state was unmapped → became
      'error' → poll infinite-looped until the 6-hour timeout.
    - ``transient_miss_threshold`` is the number of consecutive None /
      'error' reads tolerated before declaring the job gone. Sized for
      the SAB queue→history gap window (~10s) — a vanished job should
      fail fast.
    - ``completed_no_path_threshold`` is a SEPARATE, longer window for
      the "client says complete but no save_path yet" case. The download
      already succeeded, so this defaults to ~120s (configurable via
      ``download_source.album_bundle_completed_no_path_seconds``) instead
      of reusing the 10s miss window — #721 showed SAB can take 2+ minutes
      to write ``storage``. When the window is exhausted the loop falls
      back to the adapter's ``incomplete_path`` (the on-disk in-progress
      dir) if present, and only emits terminal ``failed`` when there's no
      path of any kind to scan.

    Returns the adapter's reported save_path (or, as a last resort, its
    ``incomplete_path``) on terminal success, or ``None`` on any failure
    (timeout / disappeared / explicit failed / shutdown). On every
    failure path emits ``'failed'`` once with an ``error`` field
