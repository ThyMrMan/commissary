"""Bulk server-collection deletion as a background job with live progress.

Deleting N collections is N×2 server round-trips — a Kometa cleanup can be
thousands (Boulder's first run: 1,500), which is far too long for one HTTP
request. So the delete endpoint starts THIS job and returns immediately; the
studio follows along over socketio ('collections:cleanup', throttled to ~1/s
via the shared JobChannel) with a status endpoint as the polling fallback.

Managed collections get their sync-ledger row cleared on successful delete (no
ghost tracking; the next sync recreates them while their definition stays
enabled). Definitions and titles are never touched.

        stripped by a 'sync'-mode diff; the user can flip to sync later.
      * keep_server_art — the collection's existing poster is the user's choice;
