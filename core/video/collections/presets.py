"""Preset packs — Kometa-style one-click collections, expanded against the
user's OWN library.

A pack is a template ("Genres", "Decades", "Franchises", …) that expands into
concrete collection candidates with real owned counts, so the studio can show
"Action · 142" before anything is created. Applying a pack just calls
``create_collection_definition`` per selected entry — a preset collection is a
completely normal definition afterwards (editable, syncable, deletable).

Pure orchestration over the DB layer's aggregate helpers; no network, no server
I/O. The wishlist superpower rides along for free: franchise entries are
``kind='list'`` definitions, so ``wishlist_missing`` works exactly as it does
for hand-built list collections.
