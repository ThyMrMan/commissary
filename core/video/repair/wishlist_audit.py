"""Wishlist Audit job — rows the acquisition pipeline will never act on.

Scan: wishlist entries whose target is ALREADY OWNED **and done** — the owned
copy meets the quality cutoff (nothing left to chase), or its quality is
unreadable (the upgrader can't judge it, so the drain skips it forever).
Owned-but-BELOW-cutoff rows are deliberately NOT flagged: upgrade-until keeps
those alive so the drain can chase a better copy.

Fix (approve): remove the row. Nothing else — the owned copy is untouched.
