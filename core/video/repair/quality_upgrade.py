"""Quality Upgrade job — movies below the quality profile's cutoff.

Scan: each owned movie's BEST file (highest resolution, then size) is judged
against the shared video quality profile with the same ``quality_eval`` seam
the Download modal uses. Below the cutoff → one finding per movie. With no
cutoff configured ('always chase the best') the job stays quiet — flagging the
entire library isn't a finding, it's noise.

Fix (approve): a real upgrade grab — the wishlist drain's own search/pick/
enqueue seams run for the single movie (the drain itself refuses owned
titles, so upgrades can't ride it). The toast reports the actual outcome.
