"""Watched Cleanup job — reclaim disk from movies you've already seen.

The video Expired Download Cleaner (Maintainerr's core rule): a movie WATCHED
at least once whose last watch is ``watched_days`` behind is a cleanup
candidate. Optionally (off by default) never-watched movies that have sat in
the library ``unwatched_days`` are flagged too.

Approving a finding moves the movie's file into the RECYCLE BIN (never a hard
delete — see core/video/recycle.py) and marks the library row file-less; the
weekly deep scan reconciles the server view. Movies whose watch state carries
no date (the server never reported one) are skipped, not guessed.

Freshness: watch-state changes now ride the incremental scan (the Plex
lastViewedAt delta), so candidates appear without waiting for a deep scan.

Heads-up in help_text: a cleaned movie is no longer "owned" — list collections
set to wishlist-missing members can re-add it. That's by design (you chose
those lists); exclude titles there if it bites.
