"""Auto-retry logic for video downloads (the music-style depth).

When a grabbed release fails (transfer error / peer cancel / never lands), the engine
shouldn't just give up — it should try the NEXT-best candidate from the same search,
and when those run out, RE-SEARCH with a different query (e.g. a movie without its
year) and try those. This module is the pure decision engine; the monitor performs
the I/O (start the download / run the requery).

Pure (json + stdlib only); unit-tested. Isolated — no music imports.
