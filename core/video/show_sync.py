"""Per-show synchronize — a deep scan scoped to ONE show.

Fetches the show's full tree from the active video server and reconciles the
local rows through the scanner's own ingest (upsert_show_tree adds/updates
episodes + files and prunes the ones the payload no longer carries). A show
the server verifiably no longer has is removed entirely (cascades clean its
children).

Safety, in order of paranoia:
  • a server ERROR (down, timeout) aborts — it never reads as "show gone"
  • "gone" requires the source to positively distinguish not-found from a
    failed request (Plex: NotFound; Jellyfin: item missing while the server
    still answers)
  • an EMPTY tree (0 episodes) against local episodes is refused — Plex's
    tree builder swallows a mid-fetch episodes() failure into an empty
    seasons list, and blindly upserting that would prune the whole show
