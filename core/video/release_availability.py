"""When is a movie actually DOWNLOADABLE — i.e. home/digital-released, not just in cinemas?

Radarr's "minimum availability = released": the wishlist drain must not chase a film that's
only in theatres (there's no real WEB-DL/BluRay yet, so it can only match a wrong/fake copy).
This computes an "available date" from TMDB's per-country release-date data: the earliest
digital / physical / TV date when TMDB has one, otherwise the earliest theatrical date plus a
typical home-release window. Pure + stdlib-only, so it's unit-tested in isolation.
