"""
SoundCloud Download Client
Alternative music download source using yt-dlp's SoundCloud extractor.

This client provides:
- SoundCloud search via the `scsearch` extractor
- Anonymous public-track downloads (no auth required)
- Drop-in replacement compatible with the existing TidalDownloadClient /
  QobuzClient / HiFiClient / DeezerDownloadClient interface

The client is intentionally NOT wired into web_server.py, settings UI, or
the unified search dispatch. Build/test in isolation first; integration
ships in a follow-up PR once the client is verified end-to-end.

Quality reality check:
- Anonymous SoundCloud serves 128 kbps MP3 for most public tracks. A few
  uploaders flag tracks for 256 kbps AAC streaming via SoundCloud Go+, but
  those require an authenticated session; we only fetch the publicly
  available transcoding.
- No FLAC. SoundCloud doesn't expose lossless to anyone, ever.
- Many tracks (especially DJ mixes) are >60 minutes long. Downloads can
  be large; the integrity check still applies downstream.
