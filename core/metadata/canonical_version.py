"""Pick the canonical album release by best-fit to the user's actual files.

Issue #765 / #767-Bug2: SoulSync never pins ONE canonical album version per
album, so the Library Reorganizer, Track Number Repair, and tagging each
re-resolve independently and can land on different releases (standard vs
deluxe; Spotify vs MusicBrainz track numbering) and contradict each other.

This module is the pure, testable heart of the fix: given the metadata of the
files actually on disk and a set of candidate releases, score each release by
how well it FITS those files and pick the best. "Best-fit to the files" means:

  - track-count fit   — a 17-track deluxe is a poor fit for 11 files on disk
  - duration alignment — each file should line up with a release track by length
  - title overlap      — a tiebreaker / sanity check

What this does and does NOT solve:
  - It DOES pick the right EDITION (standard vs deluxe) — the discriminating
    signal is track count + durations.
  - It does NOT (and cannot) decide which of two listings of the SAME album is
    "more correct" when they differ only in track numbering (same files match
    both equally). Instead ``pick_canonical_release`` is DETERMINISTIC and
    breaks ties toward the earlier candidate — so the caller passes candidates
    in source-priority order and every tool that reads the pinned result agrees
    on the same release. Agreement is what resolves #765, not picking a
    "winner" of the numbering disagreement.

Pure, no I/O. Callers fetch candidate tracklists and read on-disk file metadata;
this module only scores.
