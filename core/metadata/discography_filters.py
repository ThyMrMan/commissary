"""Track-level filters for the user-facing Download Discography flow.

GitHub issue #559 (trackhacs): clicking "Download Discography" on an
artist also pulled in tracks where the artist's name appeared in the
title of someone else's song. Two failure modes underneath:

1. **Cross-artist tracks.** Spotify's `artist_albums` endpoint returns
   compilation / appears_on / various-artists albums where the requested
   artist is featured on one or two tracks. The endpoint then added
   *every* track from those albums to the wishlist, including tracks by
   unrelated artists that just happened to mention the requested artist
   in the title.

2. **Remix / live / acoustic / instrumental versions.** The watchlist
   scanner has user-toggleable filters for these (default: exclude),
   stored at `watchlist.global_include_*`. The discography backfill
   repair job already honors them. The user-facing Download Discography
   endpoint did not — those filters never fired for one-off discography
   downloads, so users got remix-ladder bloat.

These helpers live alongside the existing `core.metadata.discography`
because they belong to the same conceptual layer (discography fetch
results, pre-wishlist) and are independently testable. The watchlist
content-type detectors (``is_remix_version`` etc.) are reused from
``core.watchlist_scanner`` rather than re-implemented — same patterns,
single source of truth.

    Discord report (Skowl): clicking "Download Discography" twice on
    the same artist re-queued every track instead of skipping the
    half already on disk. Trace: the endpoint added each track to the
    wishlist via ``db.add_to_wishlist``, which only dedups against the
    wishlist itself — once a wishlist track downloads it leaves the
    wishlist, so the second discography click re-inserted everything.

    The discography backfill repair job already runs the same check
    via ``db.check_track_exists`` — this helper centralises the
    contract so the user-facing endpoint matches that behavior.

    `check_track_exists` is name+artist+album based, format-agnostic.
    Skowl's "Blasphemy mode" library (FLAC converted to MP3 then
    original deleted) matches just fine — track_name + artist + album
    don't change with format.

    ``candidate_tracks`` (when not None) is the artist's library tracks,
    pre-fetched ONCE by the caller, so the check scores in-memory instead
    of firing per-track fuzzy SQL scans against the whole library. Pass an
    empty list for an artist the user owns nothing of — it still routes
    through the fast in-memory path (scores against zero candidates →
    instant "not owned") rather than the slow per-track search. None
    preserves the original per-track-SQL behaviour for callers that don't
    pre-fetch.

    Returns False on any exception so a transient DB hiccup doesn't
    silently nuke a discography fetch — a redundant wishlist add is
