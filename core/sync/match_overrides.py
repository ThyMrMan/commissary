"""Sync match overrides — user-confirmed source→server track pairings.

When a user picks a local file via "Find & Add" on the Server Playlist
compare view, that selection should persist as a hard match across
future syncs — bypassing the fuzzy/exact title-match algorithm
entirely. This module provides pure helpers that the web layer calls
to resolve and persist those overrides through the existing
`sync_match_cache` table.

Override semantics:
    - One mapping per (source_track_id, server_source). UNIQUE
      constraint on the table enforces single mapping per pair.
    - Stored with confidence=1.0 to distinguish from auto-discovered
      matches (which use the actual title-similarity score).
    - Read at the START of the matching algorithm — before pass-1
      exact and pass-2 fuzzy. Skipped sources don't re-enter the
      normal matching pool.
    - Stale-cache safe: if the cached server_track_id doesn't exist
      in the current server_tracks list (track removed from server),
      the override is silently skipped and normal matching runs.

    the user's single library copy) sharing one server track. The old

    stayed "missing" forever no matter how many times the user re-ran
    Find & Add (wolf39us). Both pairings are user-confirmed — honor both.
