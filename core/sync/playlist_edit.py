"""Pure planners for sync-editor playlist mutations (#768 Bug C).

The sync editor's "Find & add" and remove actions rewrite the whole server
playlist from a flat list of track IDs (Subsonic/Navidrome + Jellyfin have no
position-level ops). Two bugs lived in the inline endpoint logic:

* **Duplicate on manual match.** "Find & add" always *inserted* the chosen
  track — but when the user is matching an UNMATCHED source to a server track
  that's already in the playlist (an orphan "extra"), the intent is to LINK
  them, not add a second copy. Each attempt appended another duplicate
  (positions 72, 73, 74…). ``plan_playlist_add`` skips the insert when it's a
  link to an already-present track (the caller still persists the override).

* **Delete removes ALL copies.** The inline remove filtered out *every* entry
  with the target ID. With duplicates present, deleting one removed them all.
  ``remove_one_occurrence`` drops a single entry (duplicates are the same
  track, so removing any one is correct).

Pure, no I/O — the caller fetches the current track-id list and applies the
returned plan to the media-server client.
