"""Opt-in "parent folder artist" resolution for imports.

Historically the auto-import worker derived the artist from the top Staging
folder whenever the path had >=2 levels and that folder wasn't a category word
(albums/singles/eps/...). It did so *unconditionally*, overriding even a
confidently metadata-identified artist — which mass-mislabelled files when a
user staged everything under one container folder (see the "soulsync" incident).

This module isolates that decision as a pure function so it can be:
- gated behind an opt-in global setting (``import.folder_artist_override``,
  default on for legacy compatibility), and
- unit-tested without standing up the whole import worker.
