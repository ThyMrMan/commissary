"""Album-track matching helpers — lifted out of
``AutoImportWorker._match_tracks`` so the matching logic is testable in
isolation without instantiating the worker, mocking the metadata
client, or monkey-patching ``_read_file_tags``.

Diagnostic logging:
- Every match decision (matched, rejected by duration, rejected by
  threshold) emits a debug-level log when ``ALBUM_MATCHING_DEBUG`` is
  truthy. Defaults to off so production logs stay clean. Flip via the
  ``SOULSYNC_ALBUM_MATCHING_DEBUG`` env var when investigating
  "nothing matched" reports.

The worker still owns:
- File-system traversal + tag reads
- Metadata client lookup + album_data fetch
- Album-vs-single routing

This module owns:
- Quality-aware deduplication keyed on the ``(disc_number, track_number)``
  position tuple
- Weighted match scoring against the album's tracklist
- Returning the list of (track, file, confidence) matches + leftover
  unmatched files

Both behaviors are pure functions over already-fetched data, so the
test surface is just dicts in / dicts out.

    Algorithm (in order):

    1. **Exact-identifier fast paths** (``find_exact_id_matches``) —
       pair files to tracks via shared MBID, then ISRC. Picard-tagged
       libraries land here on the first pass with full confidence,
       skipping the fuzzy scorer entirely. Each match carries a
       ``'match_type': 'mbid' | 'isrc'`` field for downstream
       provenance / debug logging.

    2. **Quality dedup** on remaining files — keep the highest-quality
       file per ``(disc, track)`` position.

    3. **Fuzzy scoring** on remaining files vs remaining tracks — title
       + artist + position + album-tag weighted scoring with a duration
       sanity gate (files whose audio length is more than
       ``DURATION_TOLERANCE_MS`` from the candidate track are rejected
       before scoring, regardless of how good the title agreement
       looks).

    Returns a dict with:
    - ``matches``: list of ``{'track': dict, 'file': str, 'confidence': float}``;
      exact-id matches additionally carry ``'match_type'``.
    - ``unmatched_files``: files left over after every track found its
      best (or none).

    Each file matches at most one track. Each track matches at most one
    file. Pure function — no side effects, no I/O, no metadata client.
