"""Last-resort acceptance of a version-mismatched download.

Some tracks simply don't exist on the configured sources in the wanted cut —
every copy is, say, the instrumental. The retry engine correctly rejects each
one (version mismatch) and eventually gives up, leaving the track missing.

This module provides an OPT-IN fallback: once a track's retries are fully
exhausted, if every quarantined candidate for it failed the *same* way (same
matched version, e.g. all ``instrumental``) and there are at least ``min_count``
of them, accept the best (first-tried) one rather than failing outright.

Hard safety rules:
- Only ``Version mismatch`` quarantines qualify. Audio/artist mismatches
  (a genuinely different recording) and integrity/duration failures
  (truncated or wrong file) never participate.
- All qualifying entries must share the same matched version. A mix
  (instrumental + live) is ambiguous → no acceptance.
- The chosen candidate is re-imported with only the AcoustID gate bypassed;
  the integrity / duration / bit-depth gates still run, so a truncated or
  corrupt file is never let through by this path.

``select_version_mismatch_fallback`` is the pure decision core (no I/O) so it
can be tested directly. ``try_accept_version_mismatch_fallback`` wires it to the
quarantine store + re-import dispatch via injected callables.
