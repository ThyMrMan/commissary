"""Download cancellation + clear helpers.

Four discrete operations lifted from web_server.py:

- `cancel_single_download(client, run_async, download_id, username)` — cancel
  one slskd transfer.
- `cancel_all_active(client, run_async, sweep_callback)` — cancel every
  active slskd transfer, then clear the now-cancelled ones, then sweep
  empty download directories.
- `clear_finished_active(client, run_async, sweep_callback)` — clear all
  terminal transfers from slskd (no cancel step), sweep dirs.
- `clear_completed_local()` — prune terminal-status tasks from the
  local `download_tasks` tracker, drop empty batches, drop their locks.
  Pure local mutation, doesn't touch slskd.

The slskd-touching helpers take the soulseek client and run_async callback
explicitly; the local helper imports its globals directly from
`core.runtime_state` since those are module-level shared state and every
caller sees the same dict.

Out of scope for this PR (deferred to the batch-lifecycle lift):
- `cancel_download_task` (calls _on_download_completed)
- `cancel_task_v2` + `_atomic_cancel_task` (manipulate batch active_count)
