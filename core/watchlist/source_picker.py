"""Active-source-aware artist ID picker for bulk watchlist add.

The bulk "Add unwatched library artists to watchlist" endpoint used
to drop artists silently whenever they didn't carry an ID for the
user's currently active metadata source. A Spotify-primary user with
library artists matched only against iTunes/Deezer would see them
counted as ``skipped_no_id`` and never make it onto the watchlist —
surfacing on Discord as "Library and Watchlist not syncing
correctly". The per-artist Enhanced View sync sometimes "fixed" them
because it re-ran enrichment that occasionally populated the missing
ID, but that workaround couldn't help artists Spotify simply doesn't
have.

This helper picks the active source's ID first, then falls back
through every other supported source so an artist makes it onto the
watchlist as long as ANY metadata source can identify them.
